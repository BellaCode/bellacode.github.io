# Geoff's Management Philosophy

I currently have an open position on my team.  I insist that we get the right person onboard so I'm being patient and putting in the effort scouting, recruiting, and screening.  I was thinking about my own past job hunts and realized how hard it is for a candidate to assess their potential future manager.  How great a manager are they? Managers should be able to at least explain their management philosophy to candidates, so I decided to document mine here.  This should help answer the question, "why would someone want to work on my team?"

I think most developers that have worked for me liked how I managed the team (or I naiively accepted their lies of praise).  Of course, I've made plenty of mistakes on the job as I learned to be a better manager.  I've been over-involved in the details and did a lot of my team's job for them.  I've been a control freak and over-strict in every code review.  I delivered reviews that I didn't agree with and weren't decided by me (in one case, I should have quit my job on the spot - it will always haunt me that I didn't).  I took on being the acting manager for a very large team without understanding what I had stepped in.  

On the plus side, I learned hard lessons on how to balance direction vs. delegation, better assess performance, and manage (i.e. negotiate) down, up, and across.  I've learned to take difficult conversations head on, be open and vulnerable to push through politics, and distinguish between management and coaching.  I listened and considered the management philosophies of my previous managers and my peer managers.  I  find it facinating to closely observe managers in their natural habitats and try to deduce their management philopsophy soley from their words and actions.

It is likely rare to get to hire a team from scratch.  I've inherited all of the teams I've led.  Generally, my developers didn't have much choice in me as their manager.  I consider myself lucky that most of them were willing to give me a chance to prove I was more a benefit than a curse as their manager.  In my developer lead job, everyone on the team interviewed me to see if they thought I should be their manager.  A lot of questions were about how I would manage them, and it gave me the opportunity to vocalize my management philosophy.  I got the job and no one has thrown their badge at me and quit yet, so I'm assuming they are happy enough.

...so here's **my management philosophy***

1. Always give developers ownership

Every developer I've met wants to be  proud of something they built on their own. The scope doesn't matter - system, feature, component, class, or function - just something that is just theirs. Teamwork and collaboration are great amplifiers of productivity, but we get kinda sad if there isn't something that is just ours, something that shows off our unique talent, something that shows we had that ability within ourselves to solve a hard problem.  

People use lots of other words like passion, customer focus, individual accomplishment, etc.  I try to give each developer something that they control, where they make the call, and where they are accountable.  Basically, I treat them like adult professional software developers (gasp).

I find this makes the software development processes straightforward.  Estimates are grounded in the reality of the developers owning the work.  It is their code that needs to meet requirements, coding standards, and quality bars. I don't have to be the middle man in every interaction, they request help from and help their teammates.  I can more clearly measure their accomplishments and coach them where things could have gone better.

2. Find the absolute minimum of process

Smart, talented, self-motivated people don't need process (or managers) to force them to do the right thing.  They need process to document the team's understanding of the right things, agreement on how to get there, and to help make doing the right thing as painless as possible.  I take time every sprint to see what parts of the process are unnecesary and can be deleted or automated away. When I ask a developer how things are going, I'm usually looking for some process nonsense that is slowing them down or making their job unpleasant.  Whenever I can, I take on the boring, tedious, and burdensome process and infrastructure tasks so that my developers can apply their huge brains to important problems. I try to be the human shield from endless meetings, status reports, and form filling. I try to stay open minded to changing process as the demands on the team change and as people grow.

3. Do everything with kindness

Technology is complicated. Software problems are very hard. The software business is brutal.  I've seen code reviews that read like a comedy central roast.  I've witnessed a dev lead brag about how they could make a test lead cry in meeting and then demonstrate it (worst of all motivated by gender differences). I've I know plenty of solid developers with deep imposter syndrome cut down by arrogant peers who had to be more hard-core.

I'm an eagle scout and the scout law (Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and Reverent) is a touchstone for me.  I work at all of them and find that kindness has the most impact as a dev manager.  I evaluate every action I take with 'is this kind?'  

Kind doesn't mean I'm a doormat, that I speak only in terms of flowers and rainbows, or that priorities as a manager are compromised. Instead, it helps me put my own fears in check to give people opportunity and support to succeed.  It helps me avoid being passive-agressive when there are conflicts I would rather avoid. It he

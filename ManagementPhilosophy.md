# Geoff's Management Philosophy

I was reflecting on the difficult needle-in-a-haystack hiring developers process...

* The number of matching candidates is limited. The right candidate has to be qualified, talented, and interested in the position *right now*.
* Recruiters are a very course filter.  Rarely can they distinguish between candidates, detect exagerations of talent, or have an inkling of the technical skills required for the job.
* The hiring window limited. It has probably never happened that all the talented candidates applied at the same time.
* The interview process cannot be completely objective. Even if the process is as fair as possible, people and their faults are still involved. It is easy for the interview to not produce the right outcome.
* The offer window is limited. Great candidates don't sit around for months to see if the manager can find someone better.
* The landscape is super competitive. Even if the position is a dream job, there is likely higher monetary compensation, perks, and benefits for candidates that want a bidding war.
* The manager and team are being interviewed too. Many talented developers have worked for selfish, command-and-control, micro-management types that have made otherwise great jobs intolerable. Discovering even one conceited jerk on a team can make a candidate discard almost any offer.

...and asked myself, **"Why would anyone want to work for me?"**

I think most developers that have worked for me liked how I managed the team (or I naiively accepted their lies of praise).  Of course, I've made plenty of mistakes on the job as I learned to be a better manager.  I've been over-active doing my team's job for them.  I've been a control freak.  I chafed at delivering reviews that I didn't agree with and weren't decided by me (in one case, I should have quit my job on the spot - it will always haunt me that I didn't).  I took on being the acting manager for a very large team without understaning what I had stepped in.  

On the plus side, I  learned how to balance direction vs. delegation, better assess performance, and manage (i.e. negotiate) down, up, and across.  I worked hard to overcome my introverted tendencies to take on difficult conversations, be open and vulnerable, and distinguish between management and coaching.  I listened and considered the management philosophies of my previous managers and my peer managers.  I  find it facinating to closely observe managers in their natural habitats and try to deduce their management philopsophy soley from their words and actions.

It is likely rare to get to hire a team from scratch.  I've inherited all of the teams I've led.  Generally, my developers didn't have much choice in me as their manager.  I consider myself lucky that most of them were willing to give me a chance to prove I was more a benefit than a curse as their manager.

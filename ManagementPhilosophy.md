# Geoff's Management Philosophy

I was reflecting on the difficult needle-in-a-haystack hiring developers process...

* The number of matching candidates is limited. The right candidate has to be qualified, talented, and interested in the position *right now*.
* Recruiters are a very course filter.  Rarely can they distinguish between candidates, detect exagerations of talent, or have an inkling of the technical skills required for the job.
* The hiring window limited. It has probably never happened that all the talented candidates applied at the same time.
* The interview process cannot be completely objective. Even if the process is as fair as possible, people and their faults are still involved. It is easy for the interview to not produce the right outcome.
* The offer window is limited. Great candidates don't sit around for months to see if the manager can find someone better.
* The landscape is super competitive. Even if the position is a dream job, there is likely higher monetary compensation, perks, and benefits for candidates that want a bidding war.

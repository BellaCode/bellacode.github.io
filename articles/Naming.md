# Naming

Words matter. The names you choose in code matter.

Architecture is structure with a purpose. The right name explains the purpose of structure. Every component, class, property, function, and variable needs a good name. Name choices help or hurt the architecture.  

The right names relate the code to the problem being solved. Code that looks like the problem it is solving is called *screaming architecture*. For example, if you look at the the architecture for a shopping application, it *screams* shopping. It doesn't scream password management or programming framework. Poor names can indicate a lack of understanding the problem, solving the wrong problem, or over-abstraction.

The right name also increases developer productivity. Self-describing code requires fewer code comments. Clear code is easier to understand, call, test, and maintain.

So now that you're motivated, how do you choose the right name?  Software is complex. There are many ways to code any solution. People are complex. They have personal preferences for different names. Problems are complex. It can be hard to chose names that explain subtle problem semantics.  Here are my recommendations for effective naming.   

* Always look for a better name



* Always document imperfection
* Always verify top down
* Prefer correct grammar 
* Prefer the common tongue 
* Judiciously provide abstraction
* Judiciously distinguish differences
* Judiciously enforce consistency
* Avoid hubris
* Avoid being too clever
* Avoid false metrics (length, alphabetizing, future-proofing)
* Avoid synonyms

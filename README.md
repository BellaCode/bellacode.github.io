# Software Craftmanship
While I have been practicing software development for many years, before I read Robert C. Martin's (aka Uncle Bob) blog and the [software craftsmanship manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/), I didn't have the right term to express my goal.

The craftsmanship manifesto resonates with me. It doesn't have religious overtones, vanity certification, or the hype of other movements and methodologies.  

At my first job, the dev lead I worked for mentored me in quality software development practices. Because I had this early inspiration, I've strived to avoid compromising my coding values because of deadline pressure, silver bullet technologies, or existing poor codebases.  

The craftsman/apprentice partnership is one of the best ways to learn software development. This site is my attempt to share what I've learned.

As of 01/2019 I'm refactoring a lot of my previous posts and projects, so your patience is appreciated.

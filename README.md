### Coding

Follow minimal and complete

Use locality of reference to group related code

Comment code concisely

Judiciously create components

### Unit Testing

[Name your tests with the When/Then pattern](WhenThen.md)

[Structure your tests with the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern](ArrangeActAssert.md)

[Name your variables with the Expected, Target, Actual pattern](ExpectedTargetActual.md)

Write just enough tests by following the Good, Bad, Ugly confidence process

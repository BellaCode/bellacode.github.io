Hi, I'm Geoff Cox.  I created BellaCode to share my 20+ years of software development experience with other developers. Here you will find my best practices,  applications, open source libraries, and bookshelf.  I hope you find them all useful.

## <i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i> Best Practices

### Writing code

Follow minimal and complete

### Organizing Code

Use locality of reference to group related code

Judiciously componentize

### Commenting Code

Comment the why not the how

Write in 1st person

Use active voice

Write one sentence per line

Avoid noisy comment coverage metrics

### Unit Testing

[Name your tests with the When/Then pattern](WhenThen.md)

Comment your tests with the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern

Name your variables with the Expected, Target, Actual pattern

Write just enough tests by following the Good, Bad, Ugly confidence process

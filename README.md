  
Hi,

I’m Geoff Cox.  I currently work as a software development lead at Microsoft.  I love writing code so I prefer to spend the majority of my time in an IDE.  I am also a student of software architecture, software development practices, and the mystic art of managing software developers.  In my spare time, I am an avid (or maybe rabid) cyclist.  

I’ve seen a lot of languages and operating systems over the years:

* Middle school: I started out writing Basic on my Apple II.
* High school: I wrote several applications and won a couple of contests in HyperCard and Think C++ on my Mac IIsi.
* College: The CS department changed official languages every year. I dutifully progressed from Ada to C and then C++ on Unix.
* Career: I built strong skills in C++/MFC, C++/COM, C#, TSQL, and Javascript/Typescript on Windows.  Tack on learning a million different server technologies and frameworks.

I’ve spent 9 years of my career working as a consultant software developer for big and small software companies.  I value my time as a consultant because it forced me to be a quick learner, tenacious at overcoming challenges, and exposed me to a wide variety of problems.

I’ve also spent 15 years at Microsoft.  It is an incredible company to work for (almost all of the time) and I’m lucky that it was near my home town and college.  I value my time at Microsoft because I get to work on incredibly tough problems, work with people from around the world with wildly different ways of thinking, and can make a difference in the lives of others.

On the topic of cycling, I grew up riding my Rampar dirt bike.  In high school, I got a black and gold Nishiki 10 speed I would ride everywhere in town.  In college, I rode single track all over the PNW on my Univega mountain bike.  After college, I bought a Specialized Rockhopper A1 mountain bike, but I had trouble keeping up hard-core mountain biking with a busy work schedule and family life.  About 7 years ago, I got into road cycling on a Giant Defy Advanced 1.  I managed to ride Seattle-To-Portland (208 miles) first in 2 days one year and in 1 day the next.  It is the most difficult physical challenge I have ever completed and I am immensely proud of myself and grateful to my supportive friends and family.  Today I ride a Specialized Diverge Pro which lets my ride both road and gravel.  Finally, I can’t say enough good things about Edge & Spoke, the bike shop that has helped me countless times with countless problems.

These web pages are where I’ll share my thoughts, experiences, and solutions about all of these topics with you.  I hope it helps.

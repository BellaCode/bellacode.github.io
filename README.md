  
Hi. I'm Geoff Cox. I love writing code.

I'm a software developer with 25 years of professional experience. I spent about a decade as a consultant before joining Microsoft. I've worked with a lot of different companies and teams. I've coded in C++, C#, and Typescript on a variety of platforms. I've been an individual contributor, technical lead, and engineering manager.

I'm also an avid cyclist so I'll have some posts about that too. 

Here's some stuff I've learned along with a few of my opinions. I hope you find them useful.

# My Management Tenets

## Motivation
I currently have an open position on my team.  I was thinking about my own past job hunts and realized how difficult it was for me to assess my potential manager before applying.  I think managers should be able to explain their management tenets to candidates, so I decided to put mine in writing here.  Hopefully this should help answer the question, "why would someone want to work on my team and work for me?"

## Tenets
While there are a multitude of things to consider when making decisions as a manager, I follow these tenets.

 1 **Give developers individual ownership**

Every developer I've met wants to be  proud of something they built on their own. The scope doesn't matter - system, feature, component, class, or function - just something they can point at as their contribution. Teamwork and collaboration are great amplifiers of productivity, but we aren't happy if there isn't something that is just ours, something that shows off our unique talent, something that proves we could overcome a challenge ourselves.  

I give each developer something that they control, where they make the call, and where they are accountable.  I find this makes managing the software development processes straightforward.  Estimates are grounded in the reality of the developer owning the work.  Others can help without causing a power struggle - it is clear who is responsible.  I can better measure their accomplishments and coach them where things could have gone better. Basically, I treat my team like professional software developers (gasp).

 2 **Minimize process**

Smart, talented, self-motivated people don't need process (or managers) to force them to do the right thing.  They need process to document the team's shared understanding of how things should work and to help make doing the right thing as painless as possible.  

I take time every sprint to see what parts of the process are unnecesary and can be deleted or automated away. When I ask a developer how things are going, I'm usually seeking some process nonsense that is slowing them down or making their job unpleasant.  Whenever I can, I take on boring and burdensome infrastructure tasks so that my developers can apply their huge brains to important problems. I try to be the human shield from endless meetings, status reports, and form filling. I am willing to change process as the demands on the team change and as people abilities grow.  If you do process right, people won't even know its there.

 3 **Value technical competence by example**

I'm a developer first. I love writing code and take pride in keeping my skills sharp.  I strive to be equally good at management, but people are much harder to compile and debug.  I don't need to be the best developer on the team (it is impossible to track every line of code anyway), and I don't have to make every decision.

Having development chops lets me ask the right questions, detect when we are fooling ourselves, and resist technology hype.  It lets me help the team get code done.  I only ask developers to code solutions when I know problems are solvable and when I know I could (eventually) code it myself.  I can help scope work down to something tractable. I can be a human shield for distractions.

We can converse as developers so we don't talk past each other by having to 'dumb it down' or 'not get lost in the weeds'. I value the same things they do: time in flow, the beauty of well written code, and elegant data structures and algorithms. I know how hard it is to write code so I am genuinely grateful when a dev solves a tough problem or slogs through fixing a tedious bug.

## Summary

I think my team understands my tenets and hopefully I demonstrate them in my actions. As I continue improving as a manager, I discover new techniques to detect and solve problems earlier, but I still make lots of mistakes. My expectation is that developers will challenge me when I stray off course. In the end, I think developers stay on my team and like being on the team in part because how I make decisions is transparent.

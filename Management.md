# Geoff's Management Tenets

## Motivation
I currently have an open position on my team.  I insist that we get the right person onboard so I'm being patient and putting in the effort scouting, recruiting, and screening.  I was thinking about my own past job hunts and realized how hard it was for me to assess my potential manager before applying.  I've been lucky that most of my managers have been good and several great.

Most developers that have worked for me said they liked how I managed the team (or I naiively accepted their disingenuous praise).  Of course, I've made plenty of mistakes on the job as I learned to be a better manager.  I've been over-controlling of every line of code. I tried to do most of the coding for my team. I've demanded a level of unit testing converage that created a molasses of grueling technical debt.  Once, I delivered a review that I didn't agree with and wasn't decided by me (I should have quit my job on the spot - it will always haunt me that I didn't).  I took on being the acting manager for a very large team without understanding what I had stepped in.  

On the plus side, I learned hard lessons on how to balance direction vs. delegation, better assess performance, and manage (i.e. negotiate) down, up, and across.  I've learned to take difficult conversations head on, be open and vulnerable to push through politics, and distinguish between management and coaching.  I listened and considered the management philosophies of my previous managers and my peer managers.  I  find it facinating to closely observe managers in their natural habitats and try to deduce their management philopsophy soley from their words and actions.

I think managers should be able to at least explain their management philosophy to candidates, so I decided to put mine in writing here.  Hopefully this should help answer the question, "why would someone want to work on my team and work for me?"

## Tenets
While there are a multitude of things to consider when making decisions as a manager, I follow these tenets.

1. Developers deserve individual ownership

Every developer I've met wants to be  proud of something they built on their own. The scope doesn't matter - system, feature, component, class, or function - just something they can point at as their contribution. Teamwork and collaboration are great amplifiers of productivity, but we get kinda sad if there isn't something that is just ours, something that shows off our unique talent, something that proves we could solve a hard problem.  

I try to give each developer something that they control, where they make the call, and where they are accountable.  Basically, I treat them like adult professional software developers (gasp).

I find this makes the software development processes straightforward.  Estimates are grounded in the reality of the developer owning the work.  It is their code that needs to meet requirements, coding standards, and quality bars. I don't have to be the middle man in every interaction, they drive requesting help from and helping out their teammates.  I can more clearly measure their accomplishments and coach them where things could have gone better.

2. The best process is the absolute minimum of process

Smart, talented, self-motivated people don't need process (or managers) to force them to do the right thing.  They need process to document the team's shared understanding of how things should work and to help make doing the right thing as painless as possible.  

I take time every sprint to see what parts of the process are unnecesary and can be deleted or automated away. When I ask a developer how things are going, I'm usually seeking some process nonsense that is slowing them down or making their job unpleasant.  Whenever I can, I take on boring and burdensome infrastructure tasks so that my developers can apply their huge brains to important problems. I try to be the human shield from endless meetings, status reports, and form filling. I try to stay open minded to changing process as the demands on the team change and as people abilities grow.  If you do process right, people won't really even know its there.

3. Use technical competence to lead with authenticity

I'm a developer first. I write code and work hard to keep my skills sharp.  I try to be equally good at management, but people are much harder to compile and debug (some take offense when I try).  I don't have to be the best developer on the team and it is impossible to track every line of code across the team but I build a system-wide perspective from bottom-up and top-down.

Having development chops lets me ask the right questions, detect when we are fooling ourselves, and resist technology hype.  It lets me directly help the team get code done.  More importantly, I only ask developers to code solutions to problems that are solvable and that I know I could (eventually) code.  I can help scope work down to something tractable. I can be a human shield for distractions.  

We can converse as developers so we don't talk past each other by having to 'dumb it down' or 'not get lost in the weeds'. I value the same things they do: time in flow, the beauty of well written code, and elegant data structures and algorithms. I know how hard some of the work is and I am genuinely grateful when they solve a tough problem or slog through fixing a tedious bug.

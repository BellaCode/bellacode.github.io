The traditional resume format is terrible.
It was built for a 1950s career path, workplace, and hiring process that no longer exists.
When I'm hiring, I'm looking for more than big company names and a laundry list of technologies.
I want to understand the context of a candidate's experience, the depth and nuances of their skills, where they are on their career journey, and what they are passionate about doing next.
A resume should convey meaningful information that builds confidenence the jobs is a great fit for them.




Every six months to a year, I update my resume. 
I find it is easier to spend thirty minutes on it every so often rather than have to do a complete overhaul just before applying to the next job.
Working from home during the pandemic left me feeling of a bit disconnected, and after updating my resume this year, I came to hate it; not the content, but the format.
It feels like a bland form to fill out that no one would every really read.
Even if they did, they wouldn't really know me any better.

As a hiring manager, I've also read  a lot of other people's resumes.
The resume format is so standardized that it can be hard to remember who is who and who has done what when immersed in a blur of identically formatted documents.
My last round of hiring reinforced that the resume format is a poor information source for hiring managers.

Once you hire someone, their resume become irrelevant. 
Good bosses will spend a lot of time getting to better know their employee's real skills and talents, what they want to learn, what motivates them, and what they want to contribute.
Evidence from research and case studies continues to mount that productive teams have deeply connected relationships built on trust and candor.
The resume format discourages candidates from being open and honest about their skills, where they are in their career, and what they are looking for in an employer.

All this has led me to the conclusion that the resume format is terrible. 
We should complete replace it with something that better reflects the connected working relationship we want to build.
It should be an effective tool for both the candidate and the employer.
It should capture enough meaningful information that coworkers would want to read it to better know people on the team.
